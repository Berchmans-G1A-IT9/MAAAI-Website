The Mindanao AIDS Advocate Association Incorporated or MAAAI is an organization run by the Global Fund and has PLHIVs as members.</br>
MAAAI was formed because of the increasing number of HIV cases in Mindanao. According to estimates, 10 to 15 local residents get HIV per month.</br>
“We can’t wait for the worst to happen before we take action,” Mel Borda, the assistant secretary of MAAAI states.</br>
This organization aims to serve those who are affected with HIV/AIDS and empower them to help empower other PLHIVs.</br>
</br></br>
This organization was founded on May 09, 2009 with 16 founding members, all of which have experienced HIV/AIDS. Concerns about
HIV-related illnesses and staff deaths have an impact on a company by boosting expenditures and decreasing revenues. Increased costs are incurred for health insurance,
funeral expenses, and the training and hiring of replacement workers. It has been demonstrated that HIV culture has both good and negative
effects on health behavior.
